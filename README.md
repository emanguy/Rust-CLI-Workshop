# Rust CLI Workshop

This repository contains code that will comprise a CLI app which is able to both list and download documents from getOutline's API.

The workshop for this codebase is run in 4 steps:
1. Scaffolding out the app (pulling in CLI app dependencies and setting up a skeleton)
    * [Step 1 - Accepting Commands](https://github.com/emanguy/Rust-CLI-Workshop/tree/workshop-1/step-1-accept-command)
    * [Step 2 - Breaking out into Modules](https://github.com/emanguy/Rust-CLI-Workshop/tree/workshop-1/step-2-break-out-into-modules)
2. Setting up methods to list the getOutline documents from the API using Cargo Examples
    * [Step 1 - Add API Functions](https://github.com/emanguy/Rust-CLI-Workshop/tree/workshop-2/step-1-add-api-functions)
3. Writing business logic and tests
    * [Step 1 - Writing business logic and tests](https://github.com/emanguy/Rust-CLI-Workshop/tree/workshop-3/step-1-business-logic-and-tests)
4. Integrating the API with the business logic and commands, plus adding a download command
    * [Step 1 - Integrating app layers](https://github.com/emanguy/Rust-CLI-Workshop/tree/workshop-4/step-1-integrating-layers)
    * [Step 2 - Adding the download command](https://github.com/emanguy/Rust-CLI-Workshop/tree/workshop-4/step-2-download-command)
    * [Step 3 - Reducing copies](https://github.com/emanguy/Rust-CLI-Workshop/tree/workshop-4/step-3-reduce-copies)

The repository has branches which contain snapshots of the code at each of the checkpoints listed above. These can be used as reference during the workshop to see if you're going in the right direction.
